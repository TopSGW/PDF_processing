Re: Completed Wayleave Enclosed

I am pleased to enclose your countersigned wayleave with SSE accompanied by the cheque payment from them. This now completes the wayleave process for you and we will therefore close our files.

It has been a pleasure representing you in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
